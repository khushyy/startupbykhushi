Atithi Devo Bhava means Guest is God. 
In India guest is treated as God. Max Muller stated that If we were to look the whole world
to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power, and beauty which nature 
can bestow- in some parts a veritable paradise on Earth- I should point to India.
If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully developed some of its choicest gifts.
